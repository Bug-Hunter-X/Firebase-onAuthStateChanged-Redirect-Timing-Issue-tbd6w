# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Redirect Timing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` for authentication and redirection. The problem arises when redirection happens before asynchronous operations related to user authentication are completed, leading to an unexpected user experience.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file shows how redirecting to the login page immediately after checking `user` in `onAuthStateChanged` might interrupt other crucial actions such as profile updates which occur asynchronously.  This results in the user being abruptly redirected even if the authentication process is still updating user data, leading to data inconsistency and confusion.

## Solution

The solution demonstrated in `bugSolution.js` addresses this by using promises and `async/await` to ensure all asynchronous operations are finished before initiating the redirection.  This enhances the user experience by preventing premature redirection and maintaining data consistency.  All authentication related side effects are completed before any other page loads.
